# Estimates power and solar consumption

After analyzing and discussing a variety of potential machine-learning tasks, we collectively decided to study rough estimates of power consumption and solar/battery compensation. Our rationale for selecting this topic is based upon our shared interest in ML and renewable energy. Energy is an indispensable prerequisite for human survival and development. In the past 100 years, energy consumption has far exceeded the total of the previous 10,000 years of human history, and the problem of energy consumption has become increasingly obvious. The issue of energy reserves has become an integral part of all national and regional strategic plans. Our goal is to predict the energy consumption of solar power generation. Then get how much stored energy is needed for predicted peak/non-solar hours.
